## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

To run this project locally, ensure you have **Node.js** (v16+) and **MongoDB** installed on your workstation.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimanshuKumarRout/student-planar.git
cd student-planar
```

### 2. Configure the Backend (Server)
```bash
# Navigate to the server folder
cd server

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Create environment variables
# Duplicate .env.example into .env or create a new .env file with the following:
# PORT=5000
# MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

# Start the development server
node server.js
```
*The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.*

### 3. Configure the Frontend (Client)
Open a new terminal window or tab to keep the server running.
```bash
# From the root directory, navigate to the client folder
cd client

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```
*The client app should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (default).*
